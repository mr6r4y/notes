### FLAGS

Bit | Abbr. | Description | Extra Desc. | Category
----|-------|-------------|-------------|---------
0x0 | CF | Carry Flag | Set if the last arithmetic operation carried (addition) or borrowed (subtraction) a bit beyond the size of the register. This is then checked when the operation is followed with an add-with-carry or subtract-with-borrow to deal with values too large for just one register to contain. | Status
0x1 |  | Reserved, always 1 in EFLAGS  |  |
0x2 | PF | Parity flag | Set if the number of set bits in the least significant byte is a multiple of 2. | Status
0x3 |  | Reserved |  |
0x4 | AF | Adjust flag | Carry of Binary Code Decimal (BCD) numbers arithmetic operations. | Status
0x5 |  | Reserved |  |
0x6 | ZF | Zero flag | Set if the result of an operation is Zero (0). | Status
0x7 | SF | Sign flag | Set if the result of an operation is negative. | Status
0x8 | TF | Trap flag (single step) | Set if step by step debugging. | Control
0x9 | IF | Interrupt enable flag | Set if interrupts are enabled. | Control
0xA | DF | Direction flag |  Stream direction. If set, string operations will decrement their pointer rather than incrementing it, reading memory backwards. | Control
0xB | OF | Overflow flag | Set if signed arithmetic operations result in a value too large for the register to contain. | Status
0xC - 0xD | IOPL | I/O privilege level |  I/O Privilege Level of the current process, (286+ only), always 1 on 8086 and 186 | System
0xE | NT | Nested task flag | Controls chaining of interrupts. Set if the current process is linked to the next process, (286+ only), always 1 on 8086 and 186. | System
0xF |  | Reserved, always 1 on 8086 and 186, always 0 on later models |  |

### EFLAGS

 Bit | Abbr. | Description | Extra Desc. | Category
-----|-------|-------------|-------------|---------
0x10 | RF | Resume flag (386+ only) | Response to debug exceptions. | System
0x11 | VM | Virtual 8086 mode flag (386+ only)  | Set if in 8086 compatibility mode. | System
0x12 | AC | Alignment check (486SX+ only) | Set if alignment checking of memory references is done. | System
0x13 | VIF | Virtual interrupt flag (Pentium+) | Virtual image of IF. | System
0x14 | VIP | Virtual interrupt pending (Pentium+) | Set if an interrupt is pending. | System
0x15 | ID | Able to use CPUID instruction (Pentium+) | Support for CPUID instruction if can be set. | System
0x16 - 0x1F |  | Reserved |  |

### RFLAGS

Bit | Abbr. | Description | Extra Desc. | Category
----|-------|-------------|-------------|---------
0x20 - 0x3F |  | Reserved |  |


## CMP and JXX

This is a simple example of how CMP and JXX works:


```
        cmp     DWORD PTR [num], x  ;  (x - num) and sets accordingly CF, OF, SF, ZF, AF, and PF
        jl      .L1                 ;  if num < x jump
.L1:
        jle     .L2                 ;  if num <= x jump
.L2:
        jg      .L3                 ;  if num > x jump
.L3:
        jge     .L4                 ;  if num >= x jump
.L4:
```

## Instructions

### REPNZ SCAS

```
while ecx != 0:
    temp = al - *(BYTE *)edi
    SetStatusFlags(temp)

    if DF == 0:
        edi += 1
    else:
        edi -= 1

    ecx -= 1
    if ZF == 1:
        break
```
