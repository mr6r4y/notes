# Statistics

Terminology | Meaning | Other
------------|---------|------
Significance of test | How willing we are to reject H0 when it is in fact True | Type 1 Error
Power of test | 1 - "Probability of not rejecting H0 when it is False" | Type 2 Error

What exactly "H0 being false" mean?


# Data Science Plan

1. Cover material from Graph Databases book and be able to work with: (decent-coverage; would be used if it fits) ✔
    * Neo4j - installed and tested ✔
    * Cypher query language - some examples are done ✔
1. Cover material from Data Science from Scratch book  (read once; must be put in practice) ✔
1. Do http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/index.html (in progress)
1. Gather ideas for data science project that have practical impact in the company:
    * have a collected relatively large dataset to work with
    * get to know your data using plain statistics
    * make machine learning PoC using some of the studied machine learning libraries and algorithms
1. More depth on Statistics (optionally cover R lang):
    * OpenIntro Statistics - https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os
    * The Book of R (optional)
    * Statistics Done Wrong (optional)
    * Discovering Statistics Using R (optional)
1. Go into AI:
    * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (in progress)
    * Deep Learining with Python (Manning) (in progress)
    * Do the https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
    * See The Connection between Competitive Informatics and AI/ML
    * AI with Python (Packt)
    * Deep Learning with Python (video) (Packt)
1. (optional) Security related projects:
    * learn from Data-Driven Security book
1. Have several data science projects and make AI/ML PoC (extended (3))
1. Explore options to apply AI/ML in current QA automation approach.


## The Connection between Competitive Informatics and AI/ML

In competitive informatics most of the challenges are related to problems of searching. Searching is the essence of AI and AI algorithms. Gaining knowledge of good old algorithms and challenges definitely will bring better understanding of the subject.

Some books to practice:

* The Algorithm Design Manual 2nd ed
* Programming=Algorithms++
* Artificial Intelligence for Games (optional)
